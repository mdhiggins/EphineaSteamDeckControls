**Unofficial Steam Deck controller configuration for Ephinea (Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst)**

This layout is designed for fast, intuitive access to all 10 action bar buttons without relying on radial menus or needing to look down at the controller. It also includes an optional cursor mode for launcher/LUA interaction, along with full support for all 12 quick chat commands.

## Features

### Action Bar

The 10 action bar buttons (keys `1` to `0`) are mapped for no-look access using both trackpads and rear buttons:

* **Left Trackpad**: Corners mapped to `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`
* **Right Trackpad**: Corners mapped to `7`, `8`, `9`, and `0`
* **L4 (Rear Left)**: `5`
* **R4 (Rear Right)**: `6`

This setup allows you to access all actions during gameplay quickly and reliably.

### Triggers (Subpalette)

Hold either the left or right trigger to switch to the subpalette. This allows continued use of either trackpad while holding a trigger—ideal for managing techs or items on the fly.

### Chat Commands (F1–F12)

Hold both bumpers (L1 and R1) to enter Chat Command Mode:

* **D-Pad** → F1–F4
* **ABXY** → F5–F8
* **Rear Buttons** (L4/R4, L5/R5) → F9–F12

This is useful for quick access to shortcuts, team commands, or emotes.

Additionally:

* **D-Pad Down** and **A Button** (long press) are mapped to commands that may be more sensitive (e.g., `/lobby`)

### Chat Window

* **Press Select** to open the chat window
* **Long Press Select** to toggle between Team and Standard chat modes

### Rear Extras

Low rear buttons are bound to menu activites so you can access these while staying on the move

* L5 is bound to your equipment menu
* R5 is bound to your mag menu

### Cursor Mode

Cursor mode is useful for interacting with the Ephinea launcher or in-game LUA elements.

* **Hold Start** to toggle between Default Mode and Cursor Mode

### Camera Controls

Optimized for use with Ephinea’s analog camera support:

* **Click Left Stick** to zoom in
* **Click Right Stick** to zoom out
* **Hold Left Bumper** to align the camera (classic PSO-style)

Tip: Set the analog camera sensitivity to a negative value to avoid inverted controls. Mouse input must be enabled for zoom functions to work.

![Configuration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ba72e3c-9545-47ec-93c8-d02aa264f598)

* Enable **Mouse Input** (required for zoom in/out)
* Leave **Keyboard Controls** at default. The chat command functions assume **Shift** is held when needed, so this must not be changed.
